	"about.text.li1_1": "Get a beautiful, modern, long-lasting makeup and a beautiful hairstyle.",

	"about.text.li2_1": "Professionalism. I am constantly improving my knowledge and introducing the best practices into my practice.",
	"about.text.li2_2": "Neatness and cleanliness. I carefully process the brushes after each client, using disposable tools where necessary.",
	"about.text.li2_3": "Comfort. I am able to hear the wishes of clients and their needs.",

	"tips.remove.header": "The rules of makeup removal",
	"tips.remove.text1": "Skin care is based on removing makeup: sometimes it is enough to adjust the cleansing process to achieve a noticeable improvement in relief, color, seboregulation and even the acne situation. But even if there are no problems with regular cleansing, questions arise from time to time. I am sharing detailed instructions on makeup removal.",
	"tips.remove.text2": "The first and most important thing. Who needs a makeup removal?",
	"tips.remove.text3": "Almost everyone. Yes, even for those who do not use decorative cosmetics at all. Check yourself: if you can sign at least one statement from this list, then a demotion is necessary:",
	"tips.remove.li1_1": "I have oily or combination skin.",
	"tips.remove.li1_2": "I leave the house during the day.",
	"tips.remove.li1_3": "I sweat a lot.",
	"tips.remove.li1_4": "In the morning, I apply facial care.",
	"tips.remove.li1_5": "I do makeup regularly.",
	"tips.remove.text4": "It seems that the makeup removal is only about make-up. In fact, its purpose is to remove everything from the skin of the face except the natural one.",
	"tips.remove.text5": "Why is this necessary?",
	"tips.remove.li2_1": "Firstly, everything that we apply to the skin (cream, tone) is guaranteed to oxidize, forming free radicals (the main cause of aging).",
	"tips.remove.li2_2": "Secondly, sebum from the sebaceous glands cannot freely reach the surface of the skin if all the passages are closed (one of the causes of inflammation).",
	"tips.remove.li2_3": "And finally, poorly cleansed skin does not perceive the care products applied on top (one of the reasons for dullness). It turns out that it is more profitable to wash off cosmetics in any case than not to wash it off. Even if you really want to go to bed as soon as possible.",
	"tips.remove.text6": "Cleansing the skin is not only an evening procedure. It is also necessary in the morning, especially if you use active products at night, and wake up the next morning with a shine in the T-zone.",
	"tips.remove.text7": "How not to make a demo: 5 common mistakes:",
	"tips.remove.subheader1": "1. Soap and other alkaline products.",
	"tips.remove.subheader1.text": "Everything is simple here: the pH of the skin is 5.5, the pH of the soap is 9-10. Alkaline soap shifts the acidity of the skin and opens it to infections, and it is through the cells of the epidermis that most bacteria and viruses enter the body. At the first stage of the demaking, the pH of the product should not exceed 6. Even if the number is not indicated on the label, this can be understood by whether the product foams or not (the less foams, the better).",
	"tips.remove.subheader2": "2. Before the creak.",
	"tips.remove.subheader2.text": "A creak is a sure sign that the hydrolipidic mantle of the skin has dissolved along with the impurities. The momentary feeling of cleanliness is quickly replaced by tightness, irritability of the skin, and subsequently by itching and uncontrolled rashes.",
	"tips.remove.subheader3": "3. Napkins.",
	"tips.remove.subheader3.text": "Express methods can only be resorted to as an exception. Wipes are not suitable for regular makeup removal: they only smear dirt, but do not wash them off, contain preservatives, can injure the skin and are extremely unecological.",
	"tips.remove.subheader4": "4. Hot water.",
	"tips.remove.subheader4.text": "Hot water aggressively breaks down fats on the skin and provides shock therapy to capillaries located under the upper layers of the skin. The skin can react to such treatment in any way — from acne to rosacea.",
	"tips.remove.subheader5": "5. Scrub.",
	"tips.remove.subheader5.text": "A scrub is not a means of demaking or even a means of cleansing. This is an exfoliating agent that is applied at a completely different stage and with a different frequency. Scrubs are not suitable for everyday makeup in any form.",
	"tips.remove.text8": "How can I wash off my makeup?",
	"tips.remove.text9": "One means is not enough. In the morning, strong remedies are not needed, because you only need to remove the remnants of night cosmetics and excess sebum. And in the evening, there is nowhere without them — dust, sweat, decorative cosmetics are added to sebum and care. For this reason, it would be good to have two products: greasy and foaming.",
	"tips.remove.text10": "Such a system is called two-stage purification and looks like this:",
	"tips.remove.li3_1": "after waking up, washing with a foaming agent;",
	"tips.remove.li3_2": "before going to bed — make-up with a greasy remedy and washing with foaming.",
	"tips.remove.text11": "At the first stage, the contamination must be dissolved, at the second — washed off.",
	"tips.remove.text12": "If you complete the process at the first stage (for example, just wipe your face with milk or micellar water), the surfactants themselves and all those particles that we tried to remove will remain on the skin. Consequences: inflammation, bumps, uneven skin tone.",
	"tips.remove.text13": "How to find your own pair of funds for makeup removal?",
	"tips.remove.stage1.header": "Stage 1: means for makeup removal.",
	"tips.remove.stage1.text1": "Format: thick cream, balm, micellar water, milk, oil, hydrophilic oil.",
	"tips.remove.stage1.text2": "What it does: according to the principle of \"like to like\", it collects excess fatty particles from the face (from sebum to decorative cosmetics).",
	"tips.remove.stage1.text3": "Application feature: dry hands on dry skin.",
	"tips.remove.stage1.text4": "What to pay attention to: soft fatty foods additionally soothe dry and sensitive skin, such products are also good in cold weather, when it literally hurts to touch the skin.",
	"tips.remove.stage2.header": "Stage 2: face cleanser.",
	"tips.remove.stage2.text1": "Format: foam, gel, cream cleanser.",
	"tips.remove.stage2.text2": "What does: It washes off the characteristic film left over from the first product and keeps the skin's own lipid barrier intact.",
	"tips.remove.stage2.text3": "Application feature: wet hands on wet skin.",
	"tips.remove.stage2.text4": "What to pay attention to: a neutral pH (about 6). If it is not specified, you can analyze the composition for the amount of surfactants (words with endings in -ate, -ine, -ide). It's okay if the ingredients on -ide are found in the middle or at the end of the list — these are soft surfactants of natural origin, for example lauryl glucoside.",
	"tips.remove.stage3.header": "Three sites that we sometimes forget about during the makeup removal",
	"tips.remove.stage3.subheader1": "Eyebrows.",
	"tips.remove.stage3.text1": "During makeup, many people apply three or four products to their eyebrows in stages, but do not pay attention to this area when cleansing the skin. This is fraught with painful inflammation.",
	"tips.remove.stage3.subheader2": "Lips.",
	"tips.remove.stage3.text2": "Even if it seems that there is no trace of morning lipstick, the pores on the skin around the lips are clogged, and the sebum in them oxidizes and darkens.",
	"tips.remove.stage3.subheader3": "Hair Growth Line.",
	"tips.remove.stage3.text3": "Make-up, like make-up, is most effective to do with collected hair, so as not to miss anything for sure. For example, the root zone, where the tone is usually also applied.",
	"tips.remove.stage4.header": "How to wash off makeup if I have…",
	"tips.remove.stage4.subheader1": "...contact lenses",
	"tips.remove.stage4.text1": "The ideal option is to remove the lenses and perform a two—stage cleansing. If this is not possible, the product for makeup removal (balm, milk, oil) instead of the skin, you will have to apply it on a cotton pad so that the application can be controlled.",
	"tips.remove.stage4.subheader2": "...extended eyelashes",
	"tips.remove.stage4.text2": "Greasy products dissolve the glue on which the eyelashes are held, so such products are not suitable for eye makeup. The way out is either extremely careful application with a strong indentation from the area around the eyes, or micellar water.",
	"tips.remove.stage4.subheader3": "...acne in the active phase",
	"tips.remove.stage4.text3": "Open inflammations cannot be rubbed with a disc, so everything soft, greasy, thick and creamy that needs to be applied directly to the skin will work as well as possible: from hydrophilic oil to thick balm.",
	"tips.remove.stage4.text4": "And a few more questions",
	"tips.remove.stage5.header": "Is it possible to wash off cosmetics from the face and eyes with the same product?",
	"tips.remove.stage5.text1": "Of course, if it's comfortable. They do produce separate products for the eyes, but they are needed only for those who are not satisfied with the result of makeup removal a universal product (for example, it does not wash off mascara well or leaves a greasy film).",
	"tips.remove.stage5.text2": "It seems to me that my remedy does not work well — it does not wash off anything the first time.",
	"tips.remove.stage5.text3": "It happens that way. For some reason, many people think that if the tool did not work in 5 seconds, then it does not work at all. In fact, most products need at least 20 seconds to break the bonds between the molecules. And if we are talking about waterproof cosmetics or a lot of makeup, then two or three washes in a row may be required.",
	"tips.remove.stage6.header": "Do you have to wash your face at all? They say the anhydrous method is better for the skin.",
	"tips.remove.stage6.text1": "This has not been proven. Manufacturers of micellar water, which supposedly does not need to be flushed, tried to teach us to the anhydrous method. It turned out that it was necessary: in most formulas, surfactants are in the first place, and they cannot be left on the skin. Completely anhydrous washing methods have not yet been invented, but you can remove the products for the first and second stages not with water, but, for example, with a damp terry or muslin towel. The method is good for everyone except owners of acne in the inflammatory stage.",
	"tips.remove.stage7.header": "Well, do I need to pick up a wash with special effects? For example, with acids or retinol.",
	"tips.remove.stage7.text1": "Globally, this makes no sense. Means for cleansing and cleansing are on the skin for such a short time that they cannot bring any moisturizing, regenerating, and even more so anti-aging effect. The best thing such a product can do is to keep the skin neutral pH, so the low pH label is probably the only one worthy of attention.",
	"tips.photos.header": "What to pay attention to before taking photos and videos?",
	"tips.photos.subheader1": "1. Do I need a makeup artist service?",
	"tips.photos.subheader1.text1": "Teamwork determines the result. The makeup artist will help to even out the skin tone, hide circles under the eyes, and sculpt the oval of the face. Theoretically, this can be done later in a graphic editor. However, the uniqueness of a good photo lies in the minimal post-processing of the received frames. Make-up artists use professional tools that will not add glare, will not distort colors and will not flow under the light of lamps.",
	"tips.photos.subheader1.text2": "It is advisable for men not to get a haircut on the day of shooting.",
	"tips.photos.subheader1.text3": "A slight unshaven appearance can add masculinity and looks much more attractive than red spots from a recent shave. A prerequisite is clean hair and fresh styling. Don't forget to put your hands in order. For men, neatly filed nails and the absence of burrs are no less important than for women.",
	"tips.photos.subheader1.text4": "In no case is it recommended to abuse alcohol on the eve of a visit to a photo studio.",
	"tips.photos.subheader2": "2. What can be improved with retouching?",
	"tips.photos.subheader2.text1": "Modern photography consists of two stages: shooting and post-processing. Post-processing includes: retouching, color correction and geometry editing. The detail and texture of the source file should not scare you: after post-processing, it will make an excellent glossy frame.",
	"tips.photos.subheader3": "3. Which clothes should be preferred when creating a business portrait?",
	"tips.photos.subheader3.text1": "Choose a classic suit if you adhere to a conservative style or casual — to create a modern dynamic image.",
	"tips.photos.subheader3.text2": "It is better to bring clothes with you — on the way to the studio or office, things may get wrinkled or dirty.",
	"tips.photos.subheader3.text3": "Don't forget the accessories — tie, cufflinks, watch. It is better to choose jewelry that is not too large and inconspicuous.",
	"tips.photos.subheader3.text4": "The shoes must be in perfect condition. But do not forget about the convenience. It is difficult to assume a free natural pose if the shoes are tight. It is better for women not to wear too high heels. It is advisable to carry new shoes in advance.",
	"tips.bride.header": "Tips for brides",
	"tips.bride.subheader1": "1. Should I have a rehearsal or not?",
	"tips.bride.subheader1.text": "The choice is yours. If you want to see how you will look on your wedding day, all this needs to be done in the same full volume as for the celebration itself. Many brides do a trial makeup to make a final decision, as well as just get used to a new look.",
	"tips.bride.subheader2": "2. Eyebrow correction",
	"tips.bride.subheader2.text": "Eyebrow correction is best done two to three days before the wedding. Before that, try not to pluck your eyebrows yourself — trust a professional. Eyebrows should be modeled correctly to make the facial features more harmonious and complement the image.",
	"tips.bride.subheader3": "3. Go to a cosmetologist if necessary.",
	"tips.bride.subheader3.text": "Go to a cosmetologist if necessary. Do it in advance, 1.5-2 weeks before the wedding or a month before. After skin moisturizing procedures, the makeup will look much better.",
	"tips.bride.subheader4": "4. Do not abuse the solarium.",
	"tips.bride.subheader4.text": "A light golden tan looks beautiful, but too dark skin is rather ridiculous. You can start visiting the solarium a month in advance and it is better to stop at least a week before the wedding so that the redness goes away. I would advise you to forget about self-tanning at all: you definitely don't need divorces and orange skin color on your wedding day.",
	"tips.bride.subheader5": "5. I advise you to buy:",
	"tips.bride.subheader5.text1": "matting wipes to periodically refresh your face and the groom's on the wedding day (so that the skin does not shine in the photo);",
	"tips.bride.subheader5.text2": "beautiful transparent or colored lip gloss to fix your makeup during the day;",
	"tips.bride.subheader5.text3": "loose powder and a brush.",
	"tips.bride.subheader5.text4": " ",
	"tips.bride.subheader6": "6. No experiments.",
	"tips.bride.subheader6.text": "Do not experiment with exotic remedies on the eve of the wedding, to minimize stress to your skin. Also, try not to drink too much liquid and do not eat spicy and fatty foods.",
	"tips.bride.subheader7": "7. Get enough sleep!",
	"tips.bride.subheader7.text": "It probably sounds strange, but often the last preparations are delayed until late at night, and pre-wedding experiences do not allow you to sleep, and you need to get up very early. Hence the bruises under the eyes, fatigue, but there is a very long and emotional day ahead. Therefore, think about and prepare everything in advance, do not leave anything at the last moment so that you have time for a sound healthy sleep.",
	"tips.bride.subheader8": "8. Be sure to wash your hair at night and dry it.",
	"tips.bride.subheader8.text": "It is better not to apply oils to damp hair. The hairstyle lasts much longer on dry hair.",
	"tips.bride.subheader9": "9. Calm atmosphere.",
	"tips.bride.subheader9.text": "It is desirable that the bride's preparation takes place in a calm atmosphere, so try to make sure that only you, the makeup artist or the stylist are in the room (the exception is the photographer). Don't let anyone distract you, including the phone. The bride does the makeup together with the master (looks where she needs to, etc.).",
	"tips.bride.text": "Use these tips to be and feel irresistible on your wedding day. May this day be remembered as one of the happiest!",
